# Bypassing access controls using email address parsing discrepancies

### Goal -

Exploit a logic flaw in email address parsing to bypass access controls.


### Vulnerability / Concept

This lab demonstrates a vulnerability in the logic flaws category.

This lab validates email addresses to prevent attackers from registering addresses from unauthorized domains. There is a parser discrepancy in the validation logic and library used to parse email addresses.

The vulnerability exists because the application fails to properly validate, sanitize, or secure the user-controlled input that reaches a sensitive operation. The specific attack surface and exploitation technique depend on the exact vulnerability type demonstrated in this lab.

### Recon / Initial Analysis

1. Analyze the application's functionality and identify user-controlled inputs
2. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify requests
3. Test for the specific logic flaws vulnerability
4. Identify the injection point and context
5. Craft an appropriate payload

### Exploitation

1. Identify the email parsing discrepancy
2. Craft an email address that is parsed differently by different components
3. Use the discrepancy to bypass access controls

### Why It Works

The vulnerability exists because the application processes user-controlled input without adequate security validation. In this specific lab, the attack succeeds because:

- The application trusts the user input without proper server-side validation
- The input reaches a sensitive operation (database query, HTML rendering, system command, etc.) without sanitization
- The security boundary that should protect the operation is missing or incorrectly implemented
- The specific payload used exploits the exact weakness in the application's input handling

The PortSwigger lab description confirms this: "This lab validates email addresses to prevent attackers from registering addresses from unauthorized domains. There is a parser discrepancy in the validation logic and library used to parse email addr"

### Attack Flow

**Attack Flow:**

```
Attacker Input (payload in request)
        ↓
Application Functionality (processes user input)
        ↓
Server Processing (no validation/sanitization)
        ↓
Injection Point (input reaches sensitive operation)
        ↓
Exploitation (payload executes as intended)
        ↓
Lab Objective Achieved
```

### Real-World Impact

An attacker could purchase items at reduced prices, bypass multi-step workflows, access functionality outside their privilege level, manipulate application state for financial gain, bypass rate limits, or cause data corruption.

### Detection / Testing Methodology

1. Identify business-critical parameters (prices, quantities, discount codes, roles)
2. Test if client-side values can be modified to affect server-side logic
3. Test multi-step workflows for sequence bypass (skip steps, replay, out-of-order)
4. Check for inconsistent handling of exceptional input (very large, negative, unexpected values)
5. Test rate limits and brute-force protections
6. Look for encryption oracles and state machine flaws

### Remediation

- Implement server-side validation for all business-critical parameters (prices, quantities, roles)
- Never trust client-side values for pricing, permissions, or workflow state
- Enforce workflow sequence integrity server-side
- Use server-side state machines for multi-step processes
- Implement consistency checks for financial transactions
- Rate-limit based on business logic, not just request volume

### Key Takeaways

- This lab demonstrates a logic flaws vulnerability in a real-world scenario.
- The vulnerability occurs because user input reaches a sensitive operation without proper validation.
- The PortSwigger lab confirms: "This lab validates email addresses to prevent attackers from registering addresses from unauthorized"
- Burp Suite is essential for identifying and exploiting this vulnerability.
- The remediation for this specific vulnerability involves: - Implement server-side validation for all business-critical parameters (prices, quantities, roles)
