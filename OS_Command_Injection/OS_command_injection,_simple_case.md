# OS command injection, simple case

### Goal - 

Exploit command injection to execute whoami command.


### Vulnerability / Concept

This lab demonstrates a web security vulnerability that can be exploited to compromise the application's security. The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass security controls and perform unauthorized actions.

The core issue is a failure in the application's security architecture — either insufficient input validation, broken access controls, improper trust boundaries, or insecure handling of user-supplied data. Understanding the root cause is essential for both exploitation and remediation.

### Recon / Initial Analysis

1. Identify the attack surface — what user-controlled inputs exist (URL parameters, form fields, headers, cookies)
2. Analyze the application's behavior with unexpected input
3. Map the request flow and identify trust boundaries
4. Test for error messages that reveal implementation details
5. Compare authenticated vs unauthenticated behavior
6. Use Burp Suite Proxy to capture and analyze all requests
7. Check for hidden parameters using Burp Intruder or Param Miner

### Analysis/Exploitation 

As usual, the first step is to browse around a bit. Upon viewing view details of an product we get detail information about that product and we can see upon visiting a specific product a parameter named **productId **is being set. Well this is where we can try to preform command injection and i did but no luck because it fetches information by using an API which restrict all special characters. But as there is another functionality which allows us check for availability of stocks.

Let’s click the `Check stock` button, and intercept the request via Burp Suite

When we clicked that button, it’ll send a POST request to `/product/stock`, with parameter `productId=1` and `storeId=1`.

As we have two parameters, I try to inject both with different commands. This way, I can find out which parameter is injectable and in which order they are executed.

{% hint style="info" %}
💡 The script call might look something like this (likely not the exact syntax, but the general idea is the same):

```bash
echo system("someScript.sh $_REQUEST['productID'] $_REQUEST['storeId']")
```

In this case, the parameters are used as arguments for the script and the output is directly echoed back into the HTML.

There are multiple ways to execute multiple commands in one line in a shell, separating the individual commands with for example `&`, `&&`, `|`, `||`, `;`. All behave slightly differently. On Unix systems, my favorite is `;` as it completely separates the commands without side effects based on return conditions or execution order. In some conditions `&` is better as it backgrounds the command before my injection and runs my code without waiting for the other command to finish. Still, my favourite remains `;`.

<span style="color: #E03E1B">**NOTE :**</span>** when using **`&`**, it must be URLencoded**

{% endhint %}

From the response, it can be seen that both parameters are injectable, and they are executed in the order productId first, storeId second.

**Let’s execute **`whoami`** command**

comment out the remainder of the line after the `whoami` to avoid the error message of the second parameter:

### Why It Works

The vulnerability exists because the application fails to properly validate, sanitize, or authorize user input. The broken trust boundary allows an attacker to manipulate the application's behavior by injecting unexpected data that the server processes without adequate security checks.

### Real-World Impact

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:
- Access sensitive data belonging to other users
- Bypass authentication or authorization controls
- Perform unauthorized actions on behalf of legitimate users
- Potentially achieve remote code execution on the server
- Compromise the integrity or availability of the application

### Remediation

- Implement proper server-side input validation for all user-controlled data
- Use parameterized queries and prepared statements
- Enforce server-side authorization checks on every request
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Implement security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) as defense-in-depth
- Regularly test for vulnerabilities using automated scanners and manual testing

### Key Takeaways

- Never trust user-controlled input — validate and sanitize everything server-side.
- Security controls must be enforced server-side, not client-side.
- Understanding the vulnerability's root cause is essential for proper remediation.
- Burp Suite is essential for identifying and exploiting web vulnerabilities.
- Defense in depth — use multiple layers of protection, not just one.
