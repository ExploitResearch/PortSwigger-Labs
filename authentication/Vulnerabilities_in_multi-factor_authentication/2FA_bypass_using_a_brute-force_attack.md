# 2FA bypass using a brute-force attack

### Goal -

Solve the PortSwigger lab: 2FA bypass using a brute-force attack



### Vulnerability / Concept

This lab demonstrates a vulnerability in the authentication category.

This lab's two-factor authentication is vulnerable to brute-forcing. You have already obtained a valid username and password, but do not have access to the user's 2FA verification code. To solve the lab, brute-force the 2FA code and access Carlos's account page.

The vulnerability exists because the application fails to properly validate, sanitize, or secure the user-controlled input that reaches a sensitive operation. The specific attack surface and exploitation technique depend on the exact vulnerability type demonstrated in this lab.

### Recon / Initial Analysis

Based on the lab's objective and the PortSwigger solution:

1. Analyze the application's functionality to identify the attack surface
2. With Burp running, log in as carlos and investigate the 2FA verification process. Notice that if you enter the wrong code twice, you will be logged out again. You need to use Burp's session handling f
3. Use Burp Suite Proxy to intercept and analyze requests
4. Identify the specific vulnerability type by testing user-controlled input
5. Determine the appropriate exploitation technique for this lab

### Exploitation

1. Login with valid credentials
2. Capture the OTP submission request in Burp
3. Use Burp Intruder to brute-force the OTP code
4. Look for a different response (302 redirect) indicating success

### Why It Works

The vulnerability exists because the application processes user-controlled input without adequate security validation. In this specific lab, the attack succeeds because:

- The application trusts the user input without proper server-side validation
- The input reaches a sensitive operation (database query, HTML rendering, system command, etc.) without sanitization
- The security boundary that should protect the operation is missing or incorrectly implemented
- The specific payload used exploits the exact weakness in the application's input handling

The PortSwigger lab description confirms this: "This lab's two-factor authentication is vulnerable to brute-forcing. You have already obtained a valid username and password, but do not have access to the user's 2FA verification code. To solve the l"

### Attack Flow

**Attack Flow:**

```
Attacker Input (payload in request)
        ↓
Application Functionality (processes user input)
        ↓
Server Processing (no validation/sanitization)
        ↓
Injection Point (input reaches sensitive operation)
        ↓
Exploitation (payload executes as intended)
        ↓
Lab Objective Achieved
```

### Real-World Impact

An attacker could take over user accounts by brute-forcing passwords, bypass 2FA protections, enumerate valid usernames for targeted phishing, maintain persistent access via forged cookies, hijack OAuth flows, or reset any user's password.

### Detection / Testing Methodology

1. Test login responses for username enumeration (different messages/timing)
2. Test brute-force protections (IP blocking, account lockout, CAPTCHA)
3. Examine stay-logged-in cookies (decode, check if forgeable)
4. Test password reset flows (email injection, Host header manipulation)
5. For 2FA: test bypass via forced browsing, OTP brute-force, replay
6. For OAuth: test redirect_uri manipulation, access token theft

### Remediation

- Return identical error messages for all authentication failures ('Invalid credentials')
- Implement consistent response timing
- Use strong rate-limiting (per-account and per-IP)
- Require re-authentication for sensitive actions
- Use server-generated, unguessable password reset tokens
- For OAuth: validate redirect_uri against a strict allowlist, use state parameter
- For 2FA: enforce server-side, never skip via forced browsing

### Key Takeaways

- This lab demonstrates a authentication vulnerability in a real-world scenario.
- The vulnerability occurs because user input reaches a sensitive operation without proper validation.
- The PortSwigger lab confirms: "This lab's two-factor authentication is vulnerable to brute-forcing. You have already obtained a val"
- Burp Suite is essential for identifying and exploiting this vulnerability.
- The remediation for this specific vulnerability involves: - Return identical error messages for all authentication failures ('Invalid credentials')
